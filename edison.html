        <strong>Thomas Edison</strong>, in full Thomas Alva Edison, (born
        February 11, 1847, Milan, Ohio, U.S.—died October 18, 1931, West Orange,
        New Jersey), American inventor who, singly or jointly, held a
        world-record 1,093 patents. In addition, he created the world’s first
        industrial research laboratory. Thomas Edison Thomas EdisonSee all
        videos for this article Edison was the quintessential American inventor
        in the era of Yankee ingenuity. He began his career in 1863, in the
        adolescence of the telegraph industry, when virtually the only source of
        electricity was primitive batteries putting out a low-voltage current.
        Before he died, in 1931, he had played a critical role in introducing
        the modern age of electricity. From his laboratories and workshops
        emanated the phonograph, the carbon-button transmitter for the telephone
        speaker and microphone, the incandescent lamp, a revolutionary generator
        of unprecedented efficiency, the first commercial electric light and
        power system, an experimental electric railroad, and key elements of
        motion-picture apparatus, as well as a host of other inventions.
